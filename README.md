# 🚀 Algorithm Solutions by Nihat Aliyev (AliyevNikhat)

Hello! 👋 My name is **AliyevNikhat (Nihat Aliyev)** and this repository is dedicated to my journey of solving algorithmic problems from various competitive programming platforms like **E-Olymp**, **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **AtCoder**, **HackerRank**, and more.

🧠 My goal is to improve my **problem-solving skills** using multiple programming languages and tackle problems with **different algorithms and approaches**.

---

## 🔧 Languages Used

- ⚙️ **C#** – My primary language for solving algorithmic problems.
- ⚙️ **C++** – For performance-intensive problems or when C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is advantageous.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

✅ Strengthen my understanding of **data structures** and **algorithms**.<br>
✅ Solve each problem using **at least two different approaches** to better understand and compare solutions.<br>
✅ Prepare for **technical interviews** and **large-scale software projects** by sharpening my skills.<br>
✅ Help others by providing **clean, readable, and well-commented code**.

## 📝 Contribution Style

🔹 For each problem:
- I aim to solve it first with a **naive approach** (basic, straightforward method),
- Then with an **optimized approach** (faster, more memory-efficient),
- Sometimes also using **alternative data structures or algorithms**.
